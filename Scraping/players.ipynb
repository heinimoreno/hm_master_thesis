    "## General Information\n",
    "**Objective**  \n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to automate the process of extracting player information from Transfermarkt pages. The data collected will include personal details such as age, value, position, height, and more, enriching the previously scraped lineups data for deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope**  \n",
    "This script scrapes player data and saves raw CSV files in the `data/raw` subfolder. The collected data will later be cleaned, processed, and merged for advanced analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**  \n",
    "The scraping process involves the following steps:\n",
    "- Defining URLs for data extraction.\n",
    "- Navigating Transfermarkt pages using web scraping techniques.\n",
    "- Collecting and structuring the scraped data.\n",
    "- Saving the structured data in CSV format for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**  \n",
    "The data extracted will contribute to a centralized dataset to facilitate insights into player statistics, transfers, and development trends. This structured dataset will be used in further stages of the project.\n",

    "## Setting Up the Chrome WebDriver\n",
    "To scrape data from Transfermarkt pages, a compatible Chrome WebDriver must be installed.  \n",
    "- **Installation**: Download the WebDriver from [Google Chrome Labs](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).  \n",
    "- **Check Version**: Find your Chrome version in `Settings > About Google Chrome`.\n"
